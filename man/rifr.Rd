\title{Recentered influence function regression (RIF Regression)}
\usage{
rifr(formula, data, weights = NULL, method = "quantile", quantile = 0.5,
  kernel = "gaussian")
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class):
a symbolic description of the model to be fitted in the RIF regression.}

\item{data}{a data frame containing the variables and weights of the model.}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of weights of x to be used in the computation of the
recentered influence function. Should be NULL or a numeric vector. Should be inside selected
data frame in the function and between quotation marks.}

\item{method}{the distribution statistic for which the recentered influence function is
estimated. Options are "quantile", "gini" and "variance". Default is "quantile".}

\item{quantile}{quantile to be used when method "quantile" is selected. Must be a numeric between
0 and 1. Default is 0.5 (median). Multiple quantiles can be used.}

\item{kernel}{a character giving the smoothing kernel to be used in method "quantile". Options
are "gaussian", "rectangular", "triangular", "epanechnikov", "biweight", "cosine"
or "optcosine". Default is "gaussian".}
}
\value{
A list containing the results of the RIF regression.
   \item{coefficients  }{the coefficient estimates.}
   \item{SE}{the coefficient standard error.}
   \item{t}{the coefficient t-value.}
   \item{p}{the coefficient p-value.}
   \item{adjusted_r2   }{the adjusted r-squares.}
}
\description{
Recentered influence function regression of a distributional statistic.
}
\details{
RIF Regressions can be used to estimate the marginal effects of covariates on
distributional statistics (such as quantiles, gini and variance). It is based on the recentered
influence function of a statistic. The transformed RIF is used as the dependent variable in an
ordinary least squares regression. RIF regressions are mostly used to estimate the marginal
effect of covariates on distributional statistics of income or wealth.

data(mex_inc_2008)

#Recentered influence funtion of each decile
rifr_q <- rifr(income~hh_structure+education, data=mex_inc_2008, weights="factor",
method="quantile", quantile=seq(0.1,0.9,0.1), kernel="gaussian")

#Recentered influence funtion of the gini coefficient
rifr_gini <- rifr(income~hh_structure+education, data=mex_inc_2008, weights="factor",
method="gini")
